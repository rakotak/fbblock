# fbblock
Hide facebook reels and ads automatically. Only for Chrome. Add 

Installation:

1. Download to directory FbBlock
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable 'Developer mode'.
4. Click on 'Load unpacked'.
5. Select FbBlock directory.

This extension is fairly simplified and inefficient, it does not prevent the resources from loading - it just hides them. I am using it because I do not want to install any adblocker extension.
Use at your own risk.
