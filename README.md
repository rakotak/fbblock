# fbblock
Hide facebook reels and ads automatically. Only for Chrome. Add 

Installation:

1. Download to directory FbBlock
Go to chrome://extensions/
Enable 'Developer mode'.
Click on 'Load unpacked'.
Select FbBlock directory.

This extension is fairly simplified and inefficient, does not prevent the resources from loading - it just hides them. I am using it because I do not want to install and adblocker extension.
Use at your own risk.
